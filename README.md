## 🎯 Introduction
Challenge Overview:
Currently Technology orgnization has a large platfrom support system which provides L1/2/3 support. Platform support requires trouble shooting, accessing variety of Knowledge base articles,running ansible automation scripts, foundational information about configuration items including thier relationships, dependencies, health, etc, etc. 

Problem statement:
All these tools require frequent context switching causing significant overhead in accesing different tools. Develop a Gen-AI enabled Integrated Platform Environment(IPE) that provides an integrated console to platform support teams with following capabilities:
1. Provide agentic capabilities for incident resolution
2. AI chatbot to contextually chat with a GPT backend on the incident/issue that they are resolving at the moment
3. Contextual recommendations
4. Ability to leverage enterprise information for troubleshooting
5. Context based data extraction

   Integrated Platform Environment should be the one-stop environment for all platform support users/teams for identifying, resolving and responding to all incidents.
